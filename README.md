## 🚧 Currently Working On

**AI Fishbowl**  
Interactive, real-time AI kiosk deployed at PSU to help CS students with department-specific questions.  
Built with multimodal AI (STT, TTS, LLM reasoning), MCP-based orchestration, and on-device hardware integration.  
Role: **Capstone Team Lead & Product Lead**

**Deep Learning Final Project**  
Studying how neural networks forget and relearn by training a vision model on sequential image classification tasks and analyzing how performance and internal representations change over time. The project tracks accuracy decay and recovery, probes what different layers retain, and compares representations before and after relearning to understand where information is lost and whether recovery restores the same features or learns new ones.

## 🧠 Technical Focus

- Multimodal AI systems, agents, and model orchestration  
- Learning dynamics, representation analysis, and interpretability  
- Backend APIs, infrastructure, and production-grade deployment  
- Clean architecture, documentation, and ownership-driven development
